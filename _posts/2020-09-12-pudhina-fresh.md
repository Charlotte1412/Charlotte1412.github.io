## Code Friendly
Code blocks powered [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/).

```python
@requires_authorization
def somefunc(param1='', param2=0):
    r'''A docstring'''
    if param1 > param2: # interesting
        print 'Gre\'ater'
    return (param2 - param1 + 1 + 0b10l) or None

class SomeClass:
    pass

>>> message = '''interpreter
... prompt'''

```
In line `code` looks great too. Even `longer lines of inline code` work.
