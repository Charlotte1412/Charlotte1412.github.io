<p class="describe-text">I am actively pursuing a Ph.D. opportunity in XR (Extended Reality) with a desired start date in Fall 2024. Leveraging the capabilities of Extended Reality (XR) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), my research ambition lies in the seamless integration of virtual and physical realms, focusing on enhancing HCI within XR, I aim to transform mundane aspects of life like industry, healthcare, and entertainment into immersive experiences that are both innovative and privacy-conscious. These topics include but are not limited to, XR security, XR in healthcare, and so forth. </p>


Having earned an M.S. in Design Informatics from the ***University of Edinburgh***, I am currently working as an XR Software Developer at the ***University of Greenwich*** in London, UK. In my role as part of the <a href="https://www.sun-xr-project.eu/" target="_blank">***SUN***</a> project, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.gre.ac.uk/people/rep/faculty-of-engineering-and-science/george-loukas" target="_blank">***George Loukas***</a> in the field of XR Cyber Security, I am dedicated to advancing the field and addressing emerging challenges.
