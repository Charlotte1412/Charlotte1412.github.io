<p class="describe-text">I am actively pursuing a Ph.D. opportunity in XR (Extended Reality) with a desired start date in Fall 2024. My passion lies in exploring the intricate relationship between technology, design, and user experience, with a strong focus on enhancing usability and addressing security and privacy concerns.</p>


Having earned an M.S. in Design Informatics from the ***University of Edinburgh***, I am currently working as an XR Software Developer at the ***University of Greenwich*** in London, UK. In my role as part of the <a href="https://www.sun-xr-project.eu/" target="_blank">***SUN***</a> project, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.gre.ac.uk/people/rep/faculty-of-engineering-and-science/george-loukas" target="_blank">***George Loukas***</a> in the field of XR Cyber Security, I am dedicated to advancing the field and addressing emerging challenges.
