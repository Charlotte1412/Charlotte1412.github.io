<p class="describe-text">I am actively pursuing a Ph.D. opportunity in XR (Extended Reality) with a desired start date in Fall 2024. The areas of interest to me include the intricate relationship between technology, design, and user experience in XR technology, as well as addressing security and privacy concerns. These topics include but are not limited to, XR security, XR in healthcare, and so forth. </p>


Having earned an M.S. in Design Informatics from the ***University of Edinburgh***, I am currently working as an XR Software Developer at the ***University of Greenwich*** in London, UK. In my role as part of the <a href="https://www.sun-xr-project.eu/" target="_blank">***SUN***</a> project, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.gre.ac.uk/people/rep/faculty-of-engineering-and-science/george-loukas" target="_blank">***George Loukas***</a> in the field of XR Cyber Security, I am dedicated to advancing the field and addressing emerging challenges.
