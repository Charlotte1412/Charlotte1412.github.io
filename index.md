      I am actively pursuing a Ph.D. opportunity in XR (Extended Reality) with a desired start date in Fall 2024. With a strong educational foundation, including an M.S. in Design Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, and currently working as an XR software developer at the University of Greenwich. Additionally, as part of the Sun project, in collaboration with the University of Greenwich's expertise in cybersecurity, I am dedicated to advancing the field and addressing emerging challenges I am driven to explore the intricate relationship between technology, design, and user experience, with a particular emphasis on improving usability and tackling issues pertaining to security and privacy.
